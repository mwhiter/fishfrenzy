This is the repository for Group C, CISC3660 Game Design, Fall 2014.

Group Members:

Just for reference's sake:

- Michael's remote is called "finalproject"

If you are getting asset errors where libgdx can't find it, it needs to be added to the Build Path. (if you download my updated changes the code should be correct). But if not, go to FinalProject-desktop, right-click Properties -> Java Build Path. Go to Source and add "FinalProject-desktop/assets".
